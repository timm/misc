Goal; human-in-the-loop AI for SE. Generalize a "frugal" representation to N goals. Optimize that "frugal" reasoner.

Background reading (currently this is an incomplete list):

- My prior work on this: [FSE'18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05067.pdf)
- [R project package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FFTrees/vignettes/guide.html) (code is slow, does not 
  generalize to N goals)
- Theory:
