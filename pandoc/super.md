# You're Just Super

You know who you are, a super star of software engineering.
You kow you are a "hero", one of the 10% of the project
that do 90% of the work.
You are the person everyone else looks too for inspireation
and giudience abou where the prpject should go.
You eat you won dog food- you don't use AI for clients,
but use it to  improve you won work as well.
You know any iplemetnation is one choice withiu a space of very many
and you know that it is your job to hustufy you chocea nd look around at alternaives.

You know big software systems ahve small parts, each of which should testable.
You kw that too much testing can overwhelm you with false positives and othr frmation
you cant process. So you are always tiningering woht you tests to design enough, but not oo may tests.

You know that finding the configuratin=ns for yo de code is challenging,
so you explore those configuations.

Yu know the world is a dynaic place and so you use AI to watch over your running system,
to recgnoce what parts of the code now need  maintainace.
