# **Software Engineering Project Evaluation Framework**
## A Multi-Dimensional Analysis Using Bloom's Taxonomy, Human Flourishing, Collective Impact, and Business Model Maturity

---

## **Introduction**

This document presents a comprehensive evaluation of 35 software engineering student projects using a four-dimensional framework that assesses cognitive complexity (Bloom's Taxonomy), holistic wellbeing impact (Human Flourishing), scale of reach (Collective Impact), and value creation architecture (Business Model Maturity). Through Greedy Agglomerative Clustering (GAC), we identified six natural project clusters and analyzed pathways for improvement at both individual project and systemic levels.

## **7. Distance Calculation Example**

**Example:** Computing the distance between **VibeDish** and **ByteBite**

### **Project Coordinates:**
- **VibeDish:** (5, 5, 4, 2)
- **ByteBite:** (4, 4, 4, 2)

### **Euclidean Distance Formula (4D Space):**

```
d(A, B) = √[(Bloom_A - Bloom_B)² + (Flourish_A - Flourish_B)² + 
            (Impact_A - Impact_B)² + (Business_A - Business_B)²]
```

### **Calculation:**

```
d(VibeDish, ByteBite) = √[(5-4)² + (5-4)² + (4-4)² + (2-2)²]
                      = √[1 + 1 + 0 + 0]
                      = √2
                      = 1.41
```

### **Interpretation:**
A distance of **1.41** indicates these projects are **very similar** overall, despite VibeDish having slightly higher scores on Bloom's and Flourishing dimensions. Both are in the **Innovation Leaders** cluster because they share the defining characteristic of high impact (4) and high flourishing (4-5).

**Cluster Assignment Rule:** Projects with distance < 1.5 from cluster centroid are considered close neighbors; distances > 2.5 indicate distinct profiles.

---

## **8. Key Insights**

### **8.1 The 14% Achievement Gap**
Only **5 of 35 projects (14%)** reach the "Innovation Leaders" cluster with high impact and flourishing scores. The remaining **86% cluster together** with moderate-to-low social impact (scores of 1-3), revealing a significant gap between technical execution and meaningful societal benefit.

### **8.2 The Tech-Impact Disconnect**
**12 projects (34%)** achieve the highest cognitive complexity (Bloom's = 5), demonstrating sophisticated AI/LLM integration. However, **10 of these 12** score only 2 on both Flourishing and Impact, showing that **technical innovation alone does not translate to social value**. The average distance between Tech Showcases cluster and Innovation Leaders is **2.47**, indicating they are fundamentally different despite shared technical sophistication.

### **8.3 The Conventional Cluster Dominance**
**18 projects (51%)** form a tightly-packed "Conventional Tier" cluster (internal distances < 1.0), representing variations on standard food delivery implementations. This suggests that **over half the class** took the "safe path" of established patterns rather than attempting differentiation through impact, business model, or holistic wellbeing.

### **8.4 The Platform Opportunity Gap**
Only **2 projects (6%)** achieve Business Model Maturity score of 4, indicating platform/ecosystem thinking. **29 projects (83%)** score exactly 2, representing multi-sided marketplaces without extensibility. This reveals a **missed educational opportunity** to teach students about platform architecture, APIs for third parties, and network effects.

### **8.5 The Flourishing Deficit**
**25 projects (71%)** score 2 or below on Human Flourishing, affecting only 1-2 wellbeing domains. Only **4 projects (11%)** score 4 or higher, demonstrating holistic impact across mental health, physical health, social relationships, and meaning. This suggests students default to **transactional convenience** rather than considering how software can **transform human thriving** across multiple life dimensions.

#### **Top 2 Cluster-Specific Recommendations**

---

##### **Recommendation 1: Tech Showcases Cluster (10 projects) - "Add Social Mission"**

**Current Profile:**
- Bloom's: 5.0 (excellent - highest cognitive complexity)
- Flourishing: 2.4 (weak - only 1-2 domains)
- Impact: 2.4 (weak - individual focus)
- Business: 2.3 (adequate but not differentiated)

**Problem:**
This cluster has the **highest technical sophistication** but the **lowest social value**. Projects include: TeamSync, SafeBites, SnapMeal AI, Clarity AI, DietSwipe, NutriCart AI, HOWL2GO, Vibe Eats, Food Print, Eatsential.

These are **impressive AI/LLM applications** solving real problems, but they're **personal productivity tools** without broader impact. Distance from Innovation Leaders: **2.47** (very far).

**Recommended Intervention:**

**"AI for Good" Requirement:**
Every tech showcase must identify **one vulnerable population or social problem** their AI could address:

**Concrete Examples:**
- **SafeBites** → Partner with schools to provide free allergen detection for cafeterias serving low-income students
- **SnapMeal AI** → Integrate with food banks to analyze nutritional quality of donated food
- **Clarity AI** → Offer free version to nonprofits struggling with software requirements
- **DietSwipe** → Create "accessible version" with voice interface for elderly or disabled users
- **Eatsential** → Partner with mental health clinics to support patients with eating disorders
- **NutriCart AI** → Focus on food insecurity - help people maximize nutrition within SNAP/WIC budgets
- **Food Print** → Build community feature where excess food/produce can be shared with neighbors

**Expected Impact:**
- **Flourishing:** 2.4 → 3.5 (+1.1) - adds meaning/purpose, social connection, or mental health dimensions
- **Impact:** 2.4 → 3.2 (+0.8) - moves from individual to community/institutional partnerships
- **Total Gain:** +19 points across 10 projects
- **Result:** Tech Showcases cluster moves closer to Innovation Leaders (distance: 2.47 → 1.5)

**Why This Works:**
- Leverages existing technical excellence
- Doesn't require "dumbing down" the AI
- Students learn **applied ethics** and **inclusive design**
- Minimal additional development time (mostly partnerships and feature tweaks)
- Dramatically increases resume value ("built AI for social good")

##### **Recommendation 2: Standard Delivery Cluster (10 projects) - "Find Your Differentiation"**

**Current Profile:**
- Bloom's: 3.0 (adequate - competent application)
- Flourishing: 1.8 (very weak - mostly convenience)
- Impact: 1.9 (very weak - transactional only)
- Business: 1.9 (undifferentiated - all similar)

**Problem:**
This cluster represents **51% of the class within the "Conventional Tier"** - they're all doing the same thing with minor variations. Projects include: Movie Munchers, Stack Shack, Foodly, WolfCafe+, Pack2Go, NCSU's PackEats, ForkCast, RouteDash, Booze Buddies, NutriBite.

These projects are **technically competent** but offer nothing unique. They're **competing in a crowded space** (food delivery) without differentiation.

**Recommended Intervention:**

**"Unique Value Proposition" Requirement:**
Every standard delivery app must choose **at least one differentiator** from these categories:

**Option A: Sustainability Focus (EcoBites model)**
- Carbon footprint tracking
- Eco-friendly packaging incentives
- Bike/EV delivery rewards
- Surplus/rescue meal marketplace
- Example projects: Any of the 10 could add this

**Option B: Community Coordination (NeighborhoodPool model)**
- Group/pooled ordering to reduce delivery trips
- Neighborhood meal sharing
- Community bulk purchasing
- Local restaurant support focus
- Example projects: Pack2Go, WolfCafe+, NCSU's PackEats

**Option C: Health & Wellness (Calorie Connect model)**
- Detailed nutrition tracking
- Dietary restriction support beyond basic filters
- Meal planning integration
- Health goal alignment
- Example projects: Stack Shack, NutriBite, ForkCast

**Option D: Experience Enhancement (Movie Munchers, RouteDash models)**
- Integration with specific contexts (movies, travel, events)
- Timing optimization (hot food on arrival)
- Multi-venue coordination
- Example projects: Movie Munchers, RouteDash, Booze Buddies

**Expected Impact:**
- **Flourishing:** 1.8 → 2.8 (+1.0) - each differentiator adds 1-2 wellbeing domains
- **Impact:** 1.9 → 2.5 (+0.6) - some move to community level
- **Business:** 1.9 → 2.3 (+0.4) - differentiation enables pricing power
- **Total Gain:** +20 points across 10 projects
- **Result:** Standard Delivery cluster fragments - some move to Community Coordinators, others develop unique positions

**Why This Works:**
- Forces students to **think strategically** about competitive positioning
- Teaches **market analysis** - understanding what makes you different
- Minimal technical changes - mostly **feature prioritization and messaging**
- Connects SE to **product management** and **business strategy**
- Makes projects more interesting to recruiters (not "just another food delivery app")

#### **The One Change That Would Help Most Projects**

**🎯 Single Most Impactful Intervention: "Flourishing Impact Statement" Requirement**

**The Change:**
Every project must complete a **Flourishing Impact Statement** addressing:

1. **Which of the 6 flourishing domains does your project affect?**
   - Happiness & Life Satisfaction
   - Physical & Mental Health
   - Meaning & Purpose
   - Character & Virtue
   - Close Social Relationships
   - Financial & Material Stability

2. **How specifically does it improve each domain?**
   - Concrete mechanisms, not vague claims
   - Measurable outcomes where possible

3. **Who benefits, and who is excluded?**
   - Primary users vs. underserved populations
   - Accessibility considerations

4. **What's the path to broader impact?**
   - How could this reach community/institutional/societal level?
   - What partnerships would amplify impact?

**Why This Single Change Matters Most:**

**1. Addresses the Biggest Gap**
- **71% of projects** score 1-2 on Flourishing (the weakest dimension)
- This dimension has the **highest standard deviation** (0.86) across cluster centroids, meaning it's the primary differentiator between Innovation Leaders and everyone else

**2. Cascading Effects**
- Thinking deeply about flourishing **naturally leads to** considering broader impact (Impact dimension)
- Understanding multiple stakeholder wellbeing **naturally leads to** platform/ecosystem thinking (Business dimension)
- It's the **root cause** intervention that influences other dimensions

**3. Changes Student Mindset**
- Shifts from "what can I build?" to "**what human need can I address?**"
- Moves from feature lists to **human outcomes**
- Teaches **empathy and human-centered design**
- Prepares students for careers in **ethical tech** and **social entrepreneurship**

**4. Low Barrier, High Impact**
- Doesn't require new technical skills
- Doesn't require complete project redesign
- **Can be added at any stage** (even to completed projects)
- Takes 2-4 hours of reflection and planning

**5. Measurable and Gradable**
- Clear rubric (0-6 domains affected)
- Students can self-assess and improve
- Instructors can provide specific feedback
- Creates accountability for impact thinking

**Implementation in Course:**

**Week 1-2 (Project Ideation):**
- Introduce Human Flourishing framework
- Require draft Flourishing Impact Statement before coding begins
- Students must identify **minimum 3 domains** their project will address

**Week 4-5 (Mid-Project Check-in):**
- Revisit Flourishing Impact Statement
- Add specific features or partnerships to increase domain coverage
- Identify one vulnerable population who could benefit

**Week 8-9 (Final Presentation):**
- Present actual Flourishing Impact with evidence
- Demo features that address each domain
- Reflect on what worked, what didn't, and why

**Expected Portfolio-Wide Impact:**
- **Current Average Flourishing:** 2.37
- **Projected Average:** 3.50 (+47% improvement)
- **Projects Moving to 4+:** 4 → 12 (3x increase)
- **Total Portfolio Points:** +39.5 points (+16.4% overall improvement)
- **Projects Reaching Innovation Leaders Cluster:** 5 → 10-12 (2x increase)

**Bottom Line:**
By requiring students to **explicitly consider human flourishing**, we transform software engineering education from **"can you build it?"** to **"should you build it, and for whom?"** - without sacrificing technical rigor.

This single intervention would move **12-15 projects** from Conventional/Tech Showcase clusters into Community Coordinators or Innovation Leaders, fundamentally reshaping the portfolio's distribution toward meaningful impact.

## **10. Conclusion**

This four-dimensional evaluation framework—combining **Bloom's Taxonomy** (cognitive complexity), **Human Flourishing** (holistic wellbeing), **Collective Impact** (scale of reach), and **Business Model Maturity** (value architecture)—reveals that technical sophistication alone does not guarantee meaningful software engineering outcomes.

**The clustering analysis shows:**
- Only **14%** of projects achieve high impact
- **34%** demonstrate advanced AI/ML skills but serve only individual convenience
- **51%** cluster tightly around conventional implementations without differentiation

**The opportunity is clear:**
By teaching students to think holistically about **human flourishing** and **systemic impact** alongside technical excellence, we can transform software engineering education to produce not just competent coders, but **ethical technologists** who build systems that genuinely improve lives.

The path forward requires minimal technical changes but fundamental mindset shifts—from features to outcomes, from users to humans, from products to ecosystems. The tools, frameworks, and examples in this document provide a roadmap for that transformation.
