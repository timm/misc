## From Open Source Data to Open Source Science

**[Men07]:** Data Mining Static Code Attributes to Learn Defect Predictors, TSE'07   
**[Men25]** T. Menzies, "Retrospective: Data Mining Static Code Attributes, TSE'25

**The Portland Context**

- Born from open source culture in Portland, Oregon
- *"We wore no suite and tie in our photos. We did not comb our hair"*
- Philosophy: `svn commit -m "share stuff"` will change SE research
- But unhappy with SOTA data mining in SE
- **Key Insight**: Walking around Chicago's Grant Park (2004) 
  - **Tim Menzies** and **Jelber Sayyad** lamented: *"Must do better... Why don't we make conclusions reproducible?"*

**The Radical Idea**

- In 2025 hard to believe "reproducible SE" was radical
- **Lionel Briand** (2006): *"no one will give you data"*
- Yet we persisted...

## Back to 2005: Birth of PROMISE Project & Early Success

**Two-Part Vision:**

1. **Annual conference** on predictor models in SE (to share results)

2. **Repository** of 100s of SE datasets: defect prediction, effort estimation, Github issue close time, bad smell detection

**Growth Trajectory:**

- Repository grew; moved to **Large Hadron Collider** (Seacraft, Zenodo)
- Research students ran weekly sprints scouring SE conferences 
- **Gary Boetticher**, **Elaine Weyuker**, **Thomas Ostrand**, **Guenther Ruhe** joined steering committee → prestige for growth

**PROMISE vs MSR:**

- **MSR**: Gathering initial datasets (**Devanbu** **[Dev15]**)
- **PROMISE**: Post-collection analysis, data re-examination **[Rob10]**

**Early Results:**

- Other areas struggled with reproducibility, while we swam in data
- Papers applied tool sets to COC81, JM1, XALAN, DESHARNIS etc
- First decade: Numerous successful papers using consistent data re-examination

---

## The 2007 Paper's Core Contribution

**Research Question**: Can data mining algorithms learn software defect predictors from static code attributes?

**Why This Matters:**

- *"Software quality assurance budgets are finite while assessment effectiveness increases exponentially with effort"* **[Fu16]**
- *"Software bugs are not evenly distributed across a project"* **[Ham09]**, **[Ost04]**, **[Mis11]**
- Defect predictors suggest where to focus expensive methods

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

1. *"Specific metrics matter"* (1990s heated debates: McCabe vs Halstead)
2. *"Static code attributes do not matter"* (**Fenton & Pfleeger**, **Shepperd & Ince**)

---

##  Menzies's 1st Law: Specific metrics do not matter

### **1st Law: "Specific metrics do not always matter in all data sets. Rather, different projects have different best metrics."**

**Supporting Evidence:**

- Feature pruning experiment on **3 dozen metrics across 7 datasets**
- Results: Pruning selected just **2-3 attributes per dataset**
- **No single attribute** selected by majority of datasets
- Different projects preferred different metrics (McCabe vs Halstead vs lines of code)
- Theoretical debates of 1990s (metric X vs metric Y) proven empirically unfounded


---

## Menzies's Corollary

### **Menzies's Corollary**: 

*"To mine SE data, gather all that can be collected (cheaply) then apply data pruning to discard irrelevancies."*

**Practical Impact:**

- Changed SE data mining methodology from "careful metric selection" to "gather everything, prune later"

## **Menzies 2nd Law**: Party time in metrics town

### **2nd Law: "Static code attributes do matter. Individually, they may be weak indicators. But when combined, they can lead to strong signals that outperform the state-of-the-art."**

**Support Evidence:**

- **Fenton & Pfleeger**: Same functionality, different constructs → different measurements
- **Shepperd & Ince**: Static measures often "no more than proxy for lines of code"
- **Our Response**: Stress-tested these views by documenting baselines, then showing detectors from static attributes **much better** than baselines
- **Key Finding**: Multi-attribute models outperformed single-attribute models<br>

**Key Quote**: *"Paradoxically, this paper will be a success if it is quickly superseded."*

---

## Unprecedented Success Metrics

**Citation Impact:**

- **2016**: Most cited paper (per month) in software engineering
- **2018**: 20% of Google Scholar Software Metrics IEEE TSE papers used PROMISE datasets **[Men07]**
- **Current**: 1924 citations (paper) + 1242 citations (repository)

**Industrial Adoption:**

- **Wan et al.** **[Wan20]**: 90%+ of 395 commercial practitioners willing to adopt defect prediction
- **Misirli et al.** **[Mis11]**: 87% defect prediction accuracy, 72% reduced inspection effort, 44% fewer post-release defects
- **Kim et al.** **[Kim15]**: Samsung Electronics API development 
    - 0.68 F1 scores, reduced test case resources

---

## Comparative Analysis with Static Tools

**Rahman et al.** **[Rah14]** Comparison:

- **Static analysis tools**: FindBugs, Jlint, PMD
- **Statistical defect prediction**: Logistic regression models
- **Result**: *"No significant differences in cost-effectiveness were observed"*

**Critical Advantage:**

- Defect prediction: Quick adaptation to new languages via lightweight parsers
- Static analyzers: Extensive modification required for new languages
- **Implication**: Broader applicability across programming ecosystems

---

## Evolutionary Applications (2007-2025)

**Extended Applications:**

- **Security vulnerabilities** **[Shi13]**
- **Resource allocation** for defect location **[Bir21]**
- **Proactive defect fixing** **[Kam16]**, **[LeG12]**, **[Arc11]**
- **Change-level/just-in-time prediction** **[Yan19]**, **[Kam13]**, **[Nay18]**, **[Ros15]**
- **Transfer learning** across projects **[Kri19]**, **[Nam18]**
- **Hyperparameter optimization** **[Agr18]**, **[Che18]**, **[Fu17]**, **[Tan16]**

**Research Evolution:**

- From binary classification to multi-objective optimization
- From release-level to line-level prediction (**Pornprasit et al.** **[Por23]** - TSE Best Paper 2023)

---

## The Four Phases of Repository Lifecycle

### **Phase Evolution:**
1. *"Data? Good luck with that!"* - Resistance and skepticism
2. *"Okay, maybe it's not completely useless."* - Grudging acknowledgment  
3. *"This is the gold standard now."* - Required baseline, field norms
4. *"A graveyard of progress."* - Stifling creativity, outdated paradigms

\

**The Problem:**

- Decade 2: Continued use of decades old data e.g. COC81 (1981), DESHARNIS (1988), JM1 (2004), XALAN (2010)
- **Editorial Policy Change**: Automated Software Engineering journal now desk-rejects papers based on 2005 datasets

---

## Menzies's 3rd Law & Transfer Learning

### **3rd law: "Turkish toasters can predict for errors in deep space satellites."**
**Supporting Evidence:**

- **Transfer learning research** **[Tur09]**: Models from **Turkish white goods** successfully predicted errors in **NASA systems**
- Expected: Complex multi-dimensional transforms mapping attributes across domains
- **Reality**: Simple nearest neighboring between test and training data worked perfectly
- **Implication**: *"Many distinctions made about software are spurious and need to be revisited"*

\

**Broader Transfer Learning Success:**

- Cross-domain prediction often works better than expected
- Suggests universal patterns in software defect manifestation
- Questions assumptions about domain-specific modeling requirements

---

## Menzies's 4th Law & Data Reduction

### **4th Law: "For SE, the best thing to do with most data is to throw it away."**

**Supporting Evidence:**

- **Chen, Kocaguneli, Tu, Peters, and Xu et al.** findings across multiple prediction tasks:
  - **Github issue close time**: Ignored 80% of data labels **[Che19]**
  - **Effort estimation**: Ignored 91% of data **[Koc13]**
  - **Defect prediction**: Ignored 97% of data **[Pet15]**
  - **Some tasks**: Ignored 98-100% of data **[Che05]**
- **Startling result**: Data sets with thousands of rows modeled with just **few dozen samples** **[Men08]**

\

**Theoretical Explanations:**

- **Power laws** in software data **[Lin15]**
- **Large repeated structures** in SE projects **[Hin12]**
- **Manifold assumption** and **Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma** **[Zhu05]**, **[Joh84]**

**Caveat**: Applies to regression, classification, optimization 

- generative tasks may still need massive data


---

## Menzies's 5th Law & LLM Reality Check

### **5th law: "Bigger is not necessarily better."**

**Supporting Evidence - LLM Hype Analysis:**

- **Systematic review** **[Hou24]**: 229 SE papers using Large Language Models
- **Critical finding**: Only **13/229 around 5%** compared LLMs to other approaches
- *"Methodological error"* - other PROMISE-style methods often better/faster **[Gri22]**, **[Som24]**, **[Taw23]**, **[Maj18]**

\

**Trading Off Complexity:**

- Scalability vs. privacy vs. performance **[Lin24]**, **[Fu17]**
- Often simpler methods provide better cost-effectiveness
- **Personal Pattern**: *"Often, I switch to the simpler."* **[Agr21]**, **[Tan16]**, **[Fu16]**

---

## Menzies's 6th Law & Data Quality Paradox

### **6th Law: "Data quality matters less than you think."**

**Supporting Research:**

- **Shepperd et al.** **[She13]**: Found numerous PROMISE data quality issues
  - Repeated rows, illegal attributes, inconsistent formats
  - **Critical gap**: Never tested if quality issues decreased predictive power

\

**Our Experiment:**

- Built **mutators** that injected increasing amounts of their quality issues into PROMISE defect datasets
- **Startling result**: Performance curves remained **flat** despite increased quality problems
- **Implication**: *"There is such a thing as too much care"* in data collection

\

**Practical Impact:**

- Effective predictions possible from seemingly dirty data
- Questions excessive data cleaning efforts in SE research
- Balance needed: careful collection without over-engineering

---

##  Menzies's 7th Law: Dumb sht\*t, works

### **7th Law: "Bad learners can make good conclusions."**

**Supporting Evidence:**

- **Nair et al.** **[Nai17]**: CART trees built for multi-objective optimization
- **Key finding**: Models that **predicted poorly** could still **rank solutions effectively**
- Could be used to prune poor configurations and find better ones
- **Implication**: Algorithms shouldn't aim for predictions but offer **weak hints** about project data

![](page.pdf){height=80%}


---

##  Menzies's 8th Law: Mud, rules

### **8th Law: "Science has mud on the lens."**

**Supporting Evidence:**

- **Hyperparameter optimization** lessons **[Agr21]**, **[Tan16]**, **[Fu16]** on PROMISE data
- Data mining conclusions **changeable in an afternoon** by grad student with sufficient CPU
- **Critical Questions**: Are all conclusions brittle? How build scientific community on such basis?
- **Where are stable conclusions** for building tomorrow's ideas?

\

**?Bayesian Approach Needed**: Address uncertainty quantification and robust foundations

---

## Menzies's 9th Law & Simplicity Challenge

### **9th Law: "Many hard SE problems, aren't."**

**Supporting Philosophy:**

- **Cohen's Straw Man Principle** **[Coh95]**: *"Supposedly sophisticated methods should be benchmarked against seemingly stupider ones"*

**Personal Experience Pattern:**

- *"Whenever I checked a supposedly sophisticated method against a simpler one, there was always something useful in the simpler"*
- *"Often, I switch to the simpler."* **[Agr21]**, **[Tan16]**, **[Fu16]**

\

**Important Caveat:**

- **Not all SE problems can/should  be simplified** (safety-critical; generative);
- *"Just because some tasks are hard, does not mean all tasks are hard"*

\

**Challenge to Community:**
*"Have we really checked what is really complex and what is really very simple?"*

**Current Focus**: Minimal data approaches - landscape analysis **[Che19]**, **[Lus24]**, surrogate learning **[Nai20]**, active learning **[Kra15]**, **[Yu18]**

---

## Contemporary Challenges & Solutions

**PROMISE Revival Strategy** (**Gema Rodríguez-Pérez**):

- Data sharing now expected for almost all SE papers
- PROMISE must differentiate: accept higher quality datasets
- Focus on enhancing current data space, conducting quality evaluations

**Steffen Herbold's** Caution:

- Early PROMISE: Collections of metrics (not raw data)
- MSR shift: Raw data + fast tools (e.g., PyDriller, GHtorrent)
- **Risk**: *"Little curation, little validation, often purely heuristic data collection without quality checks"* **[Her22]**

**Modern Data Access**: 1100+ recent Github projects **[Xia22]**, CommitGuru **[Ros15]**

---

## Current "Hot" Research Directions

**Contemporary Approaches:**

- **DeepLineDP** (**Pornprasit et al.** **[Por23]**): Deep learning for line-level defect prediction (TSE Best Paper 2023)
- **Model interpretability**: Growing research focus **[Tan21]**
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Hyperparameter selection **[Xia22]**, unfairness reduction **[Cha20]**, **[Alv23]**

**Optimize CPU-Intensive Algorithms:**

- MaxWalkSat **[Men09]**
- Simulated annealing **[Men02]**, **[Men07]**  
- Genetic algorithms

**Minimal Data Approaches:**

- How much can be achieved with as little data as possible?
- Suspicion of "large number of good quality labels" assumption

---

## Transfer Learning Surprises

**Cross-Domain Success** **[Tur09]**:

- **Turkish white goods** → **NASA systems** error prediction
- Expected: Complex multi-dimensional transforms
- **Reality**: Simple nearest neighboring between test and training data

**Implication**: *"Many distinctions made about software are spurious and need to be revisited"*

**Power Laws & Repeated Structures**:

- **Lin & Whitehead** **[Lin15]**: Fine-grained code changes follow power laws
- **Hindle et al.** **[Hin12]**: Software naturalness - large repeated structures
- **Result**: Thousands of rows modeled with few dozen samples **[Men08]**

---
