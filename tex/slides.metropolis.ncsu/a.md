# What's AI x?

- Artificial Intelligence- The ability of machine to think and behave like humans.
- How does the machine learn on its own? - That is called Machine Learning. ML is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically with experience.
- Just like humans learn with experience - Machines also learn with experience!
- Examples of common AI? Alexa, Siri, Google Home, Self Driving Cars, Robots etc.

# What's out there?

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

- In many programming languages, decisions (also called conditionals) take the form of an if-then construct. They start with a condition, which is then evaluated as either True or False.

# Let's Build that

<tiny>

```jsx
Bot.send("Are you going out to play?")  # 
async function respond(inputText){
    if (inputText == "yes"){
        Bot.send("Wear a hat");
    }
    else {
        Bot.send("ok");
    }

 }
``` 

</tiny>

What we learned. - Bot.send() method - if else statements.

# Benefits of AI Playground

- Streamlines a lot of back end operations, so that the you can just learn what AI is â€” and can get immediate results!
- User friendly!
- Designed to suit students needs.
- Students can see and publish new projects and thus learn from each other.

## How does learning AI help?

- Logical reasoning and Sequencing 
- Critical thinking
- Problem solving
- Mental Mathematics
    - The above skills are implicit skills that students learn along with AI. And this helps them in academics, life, etc.

# Extra 

The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was  proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:
$$x^n + y^n = z^n$$

Can AI, help find near misses for this equation?
