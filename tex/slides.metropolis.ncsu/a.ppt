\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Artificial Intelligence- The ability of machine to think and behave
  like humans.
\item
  How does the machine learn on its own? - That is called Machine
  Learning. ML is the study of computer algorithms that improve
  automatically with experience.
\item
  Just like humans learn with experience - Machines also learn with
  experience!
\item
  Examples of common AI? Alexa, Siri, Google Home, Self Driving Cars,
  Robots etc.

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on
different conditions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In many programming languages, decisions (also called conditionals)
  take the form of an if-then construct. They start with a condition,
  which is then evaluated as either True or False.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Streamlines a lot of back end operations, so that the you can just
  learn what AI is --- and can get immediate results!
\item
  User friendly!
\item
  Designed to suit students needs.
\item
  Students can see and publish new projects and thus learn from each
  other.

The well known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was proved to be
invalid for other exponents. Meaning the next equation has no integer
solutions: \[x^n + y^n = z^n\]

Can AI, help find near misses for this equation?
