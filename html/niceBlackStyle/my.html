<h1 id="why-i-like-lisp">Why I Like LISP</h1>
<p>TL;DR:<em> LISP makes it easy for me to write domain-specific language that let me express
what I want, in the way that I want. Which is very useful (see examples, below).</em></p>
<p>Here's a quote that's taken me a while to understand. I used to think
it was an insult to LISP. Know I think different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(A certain programming langauge)  is like a diamond. It has a 
beautiful crystal structure; all of its parts are related in a uniform and elegant way. 
But if you try to extend this structure in any way - even by adding another diamond - 
you get an ugly kludge. LISP, on the other hand, is like a ball of mud. 
You can add any amount of mud to it and it still looks like a ball of mud."  <br />
-- JoelMoses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's being said here is that LISP is built to be flexible, much more so that other languages.
Why is such flexability important Well, consider the fight over 
the walrus operator (<code>:=</code>) in Python3. 
The operator 
assignments occur as part of the expression evaluation. 
That way, if you need the result of that conditional, you do not have to run
that test again. Fror example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">#</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">without</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">walrus</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">someBigLongCalculation</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">#</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">walrus</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">someBigLongCalculation</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All in all it is a pretty minor addition to the language. 
But in accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">bike-shedding</a>
principle, it became a very contentious issue. Even after it
was decibed to add it to Python, there were some very nasty social media posts
about the whole thing and the way the issue was decided.
The whole debate was so nasty that the chief design of Python,
Guido van Rossum has decided, quit the Python project.
"Now that (walrus) is done, I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a 
(chage)  and find that so many people despise my decisions.", he said.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that in languages not designed as a big ball of mud,
any little change can become a dispute of biblical proportions.
That can't happen in LISP since it so easy to add another macro to add
another language feature. For example, here's the walrus operator in LISP
(its called the <code>anaphoric if</code> since anaphray is that part of a language that
lets you reference something mentioned in the past).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defmacro</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">aif</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">test</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">&amp;optional</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">that</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">it</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">,</span><span class="nv">test</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">it</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">,</span><span class="nv">this</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">,</span><span class="nv">that</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code lets is trap the results of <code>test</code>  in <code>if</code>, then use it later.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ss">(</span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">big</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">long</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">calculation</span><span class="ss">)</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">it</span><span class="ss">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The point here is that no central committee has to be lobbied to add this to the languate. You
like walruses? Then add the above two line and you are done.. You don't like walruses? Fine, just don't use it.</p>
<p>Here's a slightly more complex </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defmacro</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">my</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">&amp;rest</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">defstructs</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span>
