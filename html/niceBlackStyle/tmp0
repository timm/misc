# (Why (I (Love (LISP))))

!!! summary  "TL;DR"
    LISP is built to be adjustable, much more so than most  other languages. For example, here are macros
    to simplify instance management, speed up the processing of conditionals, and  make counting easier.

One thing I really love  about LISP is its flexability. 
LISP is built to be adjustable, much more so than most  other languages.
As Alan Kay said
"Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material". 
Every part of LISP's read-eval-print loop can be customized. LISP's
macro system makes it trivial to extend the language. 
Any abstraction
you use inside the code can be made explicit and useful.

Why is that important?
Well, in the [words of Paul Graham](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/acl1.txt?t=1688221954&):
<em> ... the essence of writing reusable software is to separate the general
from the specific, and (LISP programming) inherently creates
such a separation.  Instead of devoting all your effort to writing
a single, monolithic application, you devote part of your effort
to building a language, and part to writing a (proportionately
smaller) application on top of it.</em>

Not convinced?
Ok, then lets take a look at what happens in langauges _without_ LISP's flexibility.

## Attack of the Walrus

Do you
recall the fight over 
the walrus operator (`:=`) in Python3? 
That operator 
allows assignments as part of expression evaluation. 
That way, if you need the result of a conditional, you do not have to run
that test again. For example, in Python:

```text
# without walrus
x := someBigLongCalculation()
if x: handle(x)

# with walrus
if x := someBigLongCalculation(): handle(x)
```

All in all it is a pretty minor addition to Python.
Even so, the walrus operator was hotly debated and
there were some very nasty social media posts
about the way the issue was decided.
The discussion got so toxic that the leader of the Python community,
Guido van Rossum, [quit the Python project](https://hub.packtpub.com/why-guido-van-rossum-quit/).
"Now that (walrus) is done, I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a 
(chage)  and find that so many people despise my decisions.", he said.

To a LISPer, that whole debate is just insane.
If you want the walrus, it can be added with just two lines of code:



```lisp
(defmacro aif (test this &optional that)
   `(let ((it ,test)) (if it ,this ,that)))
```



This code lets is trap the results of `test`  into `it`, then use `it` later; e.g.

    (aif (big-long-calculation)
      (foo it))

Note that this change can be made to your local
LISP without having to lobby some central committee. No drama.
And if you don't like tmy `aif` macro? Fine, just don't use it.

I've got several other examples of 
how a little LISP making a useful change to a language.  
They all uses `defmacro` and if you need a little reminder on how that works:

- Most things is LISP are lists, even the code.
- Macros are functions (called at load time) that return lists which the LISP interprets as code.
  - So macros are code that rewrites code.
  - In that code, the `\`backick` defines a toggle enviornment where symbols are not evaluated,
    unless proceeded by a `,comma`. ALso, the idiom `,@list` means create the list and lay it out flat.
- Macros are "coded" so much as they are "drawn". For example, the above `aif` definition,
  the last line shows the code that is desired.

If you need the full details, and lots of good tutorial examples,
go see the [LISP cookbook on macros](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/macros.html).

## Nested Slot Accessors

Consider  
nested accesses to a field inside a struct;  e.g. the `streetNum` of the the `address` of
the `home` of the `manager` of the `company. In standard LISP, that could be done wth:

    (slot-value 
       (slot-value 
          (slot-value 
             (slot-value *company 'manager) 'home) 'address) 'streetNum)

Pretty verbose, right? So lets fix that with a little macro :



```lisp
(defmacro o (struct slot &rest slots) 
   "Nested slot accesros"
   (if slots
     `(o (slot-value ,struct ',slot) ,@slots)  ; case one: we have to recurse
     `(slot-value ,struct ',slot)))  ; case two: no slots left, so just do an access.
```



This is a recursive macro (which is a little tricky) that works front to back over a list of slots. 
The first slot becomes the inner most accessor and accessors to the other slots are wrapped around it.
With this macro, the above  example becomes something much more palatable.

    (o *company* manager home address streetNum)

## Saner Objects

I love LISP but, like many people,  I have... issues... with the CLOS object system. 
It can be so verbose to (e.g.) define and new class, or specialize the initialization of  a new instance.
Worse, the functions that (e.g.) accesss the slot names of an instance vary from implementation to implementatin.

Hence I wrote `defthing` that adds a constructor to `defstruct` as well as  method that lists
all the slots of that struct. 



```lisp
(defmacro defthing (it &rest has) 
  "adds a contructor function symbol; adds a method to return slots in this struct"
  (labels ((make (x) (intern (format nil "MAKE-~a0" x))) ;create name for make primirive
           (name (x) (if (consp x) (car x) x))) ;slots with defaults are lists, else they are 1 word
    `(progn (defstruct (,it (:constructor ,(make it))) ,@has)
            (defmethod slots ((_ ,it)) ',(mapcar #'name has)))))



```lisp
```



Then, just cause it was so simple, I wrote `defthings` which is a wrapper
around a set of `destructs` that turns them all into `defthings`:



```lisp
(defmacro defthings (&rest lst) 
  "swaps first symbol from 'defstruct' to 'defthing'"
  `(progn ,@(loop for (_ . slots) in lst collect `(defthing ,@slots))))
```



So know I can This allows for a simple instance creation. In the following 

- `(make-crew0)` and `(make-person0)` are the primitive constructors;
- while `(make-crew)` and `(make-person)`  enforce certain conventions at creation time
  (e.g., compute a person's `age` from their year of birth (`yob`)
  and the current year).

Here we go:

```text
(klasses
  (defstruct person name age salary)
  (defstruct crew  persons))

(defvar *salaries*  '((salaries '((commander . 30054) (walker . 18622 ) (pilot . 17147)))))

(defun make-person (name yob role)
    (make-person0 :name name 
                  :role (cdr (assoc role *salaries*))
                  :age  (- (sixth (multiple-value-list (get-decoded-time)))) yob))

(defun make-crew (crew)
  (make-crew0 :persons (loop for (name yob role) in crew collect 
                         (make-person name yob role))))

(make-crew '((neil 1930 commander) (buzz 1930 buddy) (mike 1930 pilot)))
    
=> #S(CREW :PERSONS
      (#S(PERSON :NAME NEIL :AGE 93 :ROLE PILOT) 
       #S(PERSON :NAME BUZZ :AGE 93 :ROLE WALKER)
       #S(PERSON :NAME MIKE :AGE 93 :ROLE FLOATER)))
```

Another macro, that is useful for frequency counts, is `freq`. This one is a little tricky.
Say some sylmbolx conds :



```lisp
; (defmacro freq (x lst &optional (init 0))      
;   "frequency counts for small group of symbols (say, less than 50)"
;   `(cdr (or (assoc ,x ,lst :test #'equal)
;             (car (setf ,lst (cons (cons ,x ,init) ,lst))))))
```



## "I don't like what you've done here"
Say you don't like the code I've got here. No drama.
We don't need
to go all walrus about it. Just delete my code and do whatever it is you
wanted to do.  And send me that revised code-- I'd really enjoy seeing how
you organize your code.



```lisp
```
