<em>
Simulating a universal, gate-based quantum computer on a classical
computer has many uses and benefits. The top benefit is the ability
to inspect the amplitudes of the systemâ€™s state directly. However,
while the mathematics is very well understood, implementing a
general-purpose simulator has largely been folk knowledge. In this
tutorial, we show how to build an interpreter for a general-purpose
quantum programming language called , capable of executing most
kinds of quantum circuits found in literature. It is presented
economically, allowing its implementation to take fewer than 150
lines of self-contained Common Lisp code. The language
 is very simple to extend, making the interpreter ripe for testing
 different kinds of behavior, such as noise models.</em>
