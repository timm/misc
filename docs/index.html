<h2>BareLogic, Inc.</h2>

<p>Today, we are introducing BareLogic, a company focused on
revolutionizing software optimization through minimal AI and active
learning methods. Our goal is to simplify and accelerate the way
software engineering problems are solved using powerful, yet
lightweight tools.</p>

<p>At BareLogic, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional
optimization methods and the potential of AI by creating algorithms
that are not only effective but also minimalistic. We believe that
software engineering can benefit from AI that is more interpretable,
less resource-hungry, and capable of delivering actionable results
with minimal data.</p>

<p>Our approach involves the development of advanced algorithms
that reduce the complexity of large-scale optimization problems,
using techniques like recursive feature selection, weighted clustering,
and decision trees. These methods will push the boundaries of
optimization in areas like multi-objective optimization, configuration
management, and defect prediction, all while ensuring that the
algorithms remain understandable and easy to implement.</p>

<p>We are committed to advancing the state of the art in software
ngineering by providing tools that empower both engineers and AI
to work together effectively. The broader impact of our work will
be seen in the efficiency and scalability of software systems,
reducing the time and effort required for development while improving
reliability and performance.</p>

<p>The market for AI-driven software solutions is vast, as businesses
around the world seek more efficient ways to build, test, and deploy
software systems. As we continue to innovate and expand, we anticipate
that our contributions will play a significant role in shaping the
future of software engineering.</p>

<p>BareLogic is led by Dr. Tim Menzies, an expert in software
engineering, optimization, and minimal AI, backed by a team of
experienced researchers and practitioners in the field.</p>

<p>We are hiring a research engineer.</p>
