# fft — random model-cloud for fairness/performance

Hypothesis: learning = inductive bias; no one bias best for all local
data + goals. So make **wide cloud of cheap random models**, read spread
(recall, precision, fairness) not tune one model. Random coverage rivals
careful hyper-param search.

## Conventions

- **Python, no deps** but `matplotlib` for plots. Else pure stdlib.
- **Lines ≤ 65 chars.** Terse. Match surrounding style.
- **`o` = attr-dict** (`class o(dict)` in `fft1.py`): `x.a == x["a"]`,
  `**x` splat, `__repr__` = `{:k v ...}` (hides `_`-keys, rounds floats to
  `the.Round`). Structs tagged `it=` (constructor): `Num Sym Data Cols Tree`.
- **Config via docstring.** Options like `-s --seed seed=1234567891`.
  `settings(__doc__)` builds `the`; `cli(the,__doc__,globals())` parses
  argv (bool flags toggle; unknown `-x` errors; `--x` runs `test_x()`).
  Defaults live in docstring only.
- **moot CSV**: header tags cols. `Upper`-first = `Num`; lower = `Sym`;
  suffix `!`/`+`/`-` = goal (y-col); `X` = skip. `?` = missing.
- **Load data AFTER `cli()`** (in `__main__`), never module top — else
  `-f`/`-g` ignored (bug: every dataset ran as default). See `pick.py:load()`.
- Don't name a script `select.py` — shadows stdlib `select`, breaks
  matplotlib import.

## Engine — `fft1.py` (library, no task knowledge)

ONE tree (random attr, supervised min-variance cut = ladder L2,
hardwired). Dropped: fastmap, `distx`, radial, `bucket`, `Bins`,
gini, the `-L`/`sup` ladder flags.

- `Data/add/adds/Cols` — incremental stats (Welford for Num).
  NOTE `adds([])` returns `None` (lazy accumulator).
- `disty(d,r)` — distance-to-heaven over Num y-cols (Minkowski `the.p`).
- `merge(a,b,s=1)` — combine two `Num`/`Sym` in O(1): `s=+1` add,
  `s=-1` SUBTRACT (parallel-variance / Welford merge + unmerge).
  Num n·var via `m2 = a.m2 + s·b.m2 + s·d²·a.n·b.n/n`; clamps n≤0
  and m2≥0. Subtraction = the trick that makes the histogram cut
  one-pass (R = total minus L).
- `binOf(c,x,bins)` — value → cut key. Sym = the category; Num =
  one of `bins` (default 7) quantile-ish edges (`c.lo`+(k+1)·step),
  so cut value is a real threshold for `cutgo`.
- `tree(root, stop=None, yfun=None, bins=7)` — random x-col/node;
  HISTOGRAM cut. `cuts(c,rows)` bins rows once into a `Num` of
  `yfun(row)` per `binOf` key, then sweeps: `total = reduce(merge,
  bins)`; Sym = each cat vs `merge(total,cat,-1)`; Num = running
  prefix `L`, complement `R = merge(total,L,-1)`; yields
  `(L.m2+R.m2, key)`. `grow` does `min` (selection in ONE place),
  retry ≤10 on degenerate else leaf = `Data` clone. impurity
  `m2` = n·var = gini/2 for 0/1 klass. default `yfun` = klass
  value; caller can swap the cut target. NUMERIC klass (0/1);
  multiclass strings crash `add`. `i` = self only, loop idx = `j`.
  (Per-model cost ~1.7× cheaper than the old per-value rescan;
  candidate count bounded by `bins`, not #values — see findings.)
- `treeLeaf(root,t,row)` — router (`cutgo` test). `leaves(t)` — yield
  leaf `Data`s. `treeShow(root,t)` — printer (ygoal=mean disty +
  per-goal means, best-first).
- `confused(pairs)` — `[(want,got),...]` → per-label `pd,pf,prec,acc,f1`
  (pd=recall/TPR, pf=false-alarm/FPR). Multi-class one-vs-rest.

## Tasks (import engine)

- `pick.py` — honest train/select/test (the live one). Protocol per run:
  shuffle → **60 train / 20 val / 20 test**; build `-m` models from
  class-ratio bags (x% pos, x in 10..90, **bag 64**) of train, each a
  **`tree(sub,16)`** (leaf 16, L2 cut); score each on val by
  distance-to-heaven over (recall,prec,fairness); best → test → ONE dot.
  Repeat `-r` times → `-r` test dots. Cloud chart = run #0's `-m` models.
  Emits `CLOUD` + `TEST` rows. `setVotes(t)` caches leaf majority once →
  `metrics` = lookup. Task-only here: `lab`/`grp`/`groups`, `setVotes`,
  `metrics`, `heaven`; engine stuff (`leaves`) imported from `fft1`.
- `prep.py` — raw fairness CSV → moot (keep-lists drop leaky cols; numeric
  age → `agegrp`).
- `thesis.py` — the headline figure (see command below). ARGS now
  `-m 800 -n 2000 -v 200 -r 20`.
- `ablate.py`/`valtest.py`/`ensemble.py`/`sup.py`/`levels.py`/`bins.py` —
  the studies behind the Findings (see below). Scaffolding, not live.
- `plot.py`, `grid.py`/`gridpick.py`/`land.py`/`panels.py` — figures.
- `compas.py`/`fairml.py` — older task variants.

Flags (`pick.py`): `-m` models/run (300) · `-r` reps (25) · `-n` TOTAL
rows then 60/20/20 (train=.6N) · `-v` max val rows · `-S` leaf size ·
`-g` protected col · `-f` file. (no `-L`: L2 hardwired in engine.)

## Commands you can just ask for

### "thesis figure for <datasets>" (headline plot)
*"thesis figure for compas adult dutch diabetes"* (any subset/order) →
build ONE combined cloud-vs-reasoning png, show it.

Run: `python3 thesis.py <keys...>`   (keys: compas adult dutch diab)
- diabetes → key `diab`; dutch → key `dutch`. No args → all four.
- writes `~/tmp/thesis_<keys-joined-by_>.png` (name from inputs). Show it.

`thesis.py` has SETS registry (file + protected attrs per key). NEW raw
dataset: `prep.py` first, add to SETS, use key. Ad-hoc: `thesis.py FILE attr1 attr2`.

Figure: rows = dataset (one each); LEFT cols = cloud (space of options,
train, run #0), RIGHT cols = heaven-selected models (result of reasoning,
held-out test); per protected attr, coloured by precision, shared scale.

## Data — WHERE TO GET IT (fresh-machine setup)

**Gotcha:** the moot CSVs are NOT in this repo and ALL paths hardcode
`/Users/<you>/tmp/`. On a new machine `thesis.py` fails ("can't find
compas/adult/…"). Two-step chain, both in `~/tmp/`:

1. RAW fairness CSVs (public benchmarks; download once into `~/tmp/`):
   - `adultc.csv` — UCI **Adult / Census Income**
     (archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).
   - `compasC.csv` — ProPublica **COMPAS two-year recid**
     (github.com/propublica/compas-analysis,
     `compas-scores-two-years.csv`). NOT moot's `COMPAS53.csv` (leaky).
   - `dutch.csv` — **Dutch Virtual Census 1971** (standard fairness
     bench; e.g. fairness-datasets repos).
   - `diabetes-clean.csv` — UCI **Diabetes 130-US hospitals 1999-2008**
     (archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296), label `readmitted`.
2. `python3 prep.py` → writes the moot CSVs `~/tmp/{adult,compas,
   dutchf,diab}.csv` (keep-lists drop leaky/id cols; age→`agegrp`;
   label→`klass!` 0/1). prep.py `__main__` hardcodes the in/out names.

Then `thesis.py` (reads `~/tmp/*.csv`). To skip all this for ONE set:
`python3 thesis.py /abs/path/to/file.csv attr1 attr2` (ad-hoc form).

Headline figure checked in at `img/l2.png` (compas+adult+dutch+diab,
L2 engine). Regen+overwrite: `python3 thesis.py compas adult dutch
diab && cp ~/tmp/thesis_compas_adult_dutch_diab.png img/l2.png`.
(NOT auto-generated under that name — it's a renamed thesis png.)
Consider vendoring the 4 prepped CSVs (~8MB) into a repo `data/` dir
to make regen machine-independent.

## Findings (2026-05-31)

- Random axis-cut ≈ radial in quality, ~2.3× faster. Split mechanism
  barely matters; class-ratio bagging + selection do the work.
- **Zero-val (select on model's own training rows) OVERFITS** → degenerate
  top-right test picks. Held-out val necessary.
- Cost now = model BUILD (`clone(base,bag)` per model), not eval. Capping
  `-v` helps little once build dominates.
- **Leakage**: raw `COMPAS53.csv` carries `decile_score`/`is_recid`/
  `score_text` (post-outcome). `prep.py` keep-lists strip them; generic
  loaders over *all* cols leak → fake precision ~0.9.
- **fairness ≠ accuracy axis**: accuracy base-rate-pinned. Use recall-vs-pf
  (ROC) or recall-vs-fairness. fairness×recall AUC gamed by predict-all-
  positive (→1.0); ROC-AUC honest.
- thesis: `-m 1000` ≈ 10min; `-m 300` full-val ≈ 3.5min (207s).
- Paths hard-coded: `~/tmp/*` (out), `~/gits/moot/classify/*` (data).

## Ablation (2026-05-31) — `ablate.py`/`valtest.py`/`ensemble.py`/`sup.py`

Q: which diversification operators raise test dots? A: **none**.
- **All 7 operators INERT.** 4800 random-config models × 4 sets: every
  operator's values tie on mean test-rank (deltas <0.03): split
  (axis≈radial), cut (row≈mid), bag (64/128/256), leaf (4/sqrt/16),
  ratio (sweep≈half), feat (sqrt≈all), p (1≈2). 80-model smoke shows
  FAKE big deltas — small-sample noise. Per-model quality = dataset +
  draw luck, not config.
- **⇒ drop all to cheapest, free speed.** axis (6.8× vs radial), bag=64
  (5.4× vs 256), leaf=16, feat=sqrt. Applied bag64+leaf16 to `pick.py`
  → 28 vs 57 ms/model. thesis `-m 800` == old `-m 300` png (inert at
  figure level). Cheaper ≠ higher dots.
- **Selection NOT the bottleneck.** `valtest.py`: r(val-heaven,
  test-heaven)=+0.90..+0.99. best-on-val transfers to test.
- **Ensemble-vote LOSES.** `ensemble.py`: majority vote over cloud →
  base-rate preds → kills recall+fair (compas heaven 1.21 vs select
  0.60). Selection beats voting.
- **"Low dots" = 2 data ceilings, not tuning:**
  1. fairness scatter = tiny protected groups. diab test-fair sd
     .06→.02, min .75→.92 as N 1000→4000. FIX = bigger N (cheap now);
     `-v` caps val so selection stays fast. `-n 4000` lifts compas/
     adult/dutch dots to top fairness band (thesis ARGS use `-n 2000`
     for speed; bump to 4000 for the tightest figure).
  2. precision pinned at base rate by label-blind splits. `sup.py`
     gini-cut lifts some (adult prec .46→.65) but trades recall; diab
     prec=base=.27, unpredictable — supervised can't help.
- Next lever for precision (color), if wanted: supervised splits.

## Supervision ladder (2026-05-31) — `levels.py` (now hardwired L2)

Ladder (was `-L`, now picked + baked into `fft1.tree`): L0 random
attr+random cut, L1 +median, L2 +best-cut, L2k K attrs+best, L3 all
attrs+best. Climbed once via `~/tmp/l{0..3}.png` (l2/l3 kept).
- **L0=L1** (label-blind, both ~h.60). **L1→L2 = the win**: label in
  cut purifies leaves, adult's low-fair scatter fixed, dots redder
  (h.586→.542). **L2→L3 = reject**: overfits 64-row bags (adult
  regresses) AND greedy best-cut collapses cloud diversity (all
  models pick same split).
- Cost (full figure): L0 227s, L2 244s (1.1×), L3 474s (2.1×).
  Supervised cut cheap because bags=64. ms/tree (bench): L0 .48, L2
  .58 (1.2×), L2k 1.47 (3.1×), L3 1.80 (3.8×).
- **Sweet spot = L2, HARDWIRED in `fft1.tree`** (no flag): one random
  attr keeps cloud spread, best (min-variance) cut adds label signal.
  diab floored regardless (precision data-property). Verified at figure
  level: simplified m2/all-values L2 == old builder png.

## Value-sampling (2026-06-01) — `bins.py`

Q: try only quantile cut-points (not all values) to go faster? A: **no
win at bag=64**. PAIRED bench (same bags, vary `bins`): bins=0 all-values
h.603; bins=5 1.4× faster but h.617 (dutch worst); bins=10/20 SLOWER
than all-values. Candidate count is NOT the cost — **tree SHAPE is**
(coarser grids build bigger trees). Helps only on BIG nodes (1200-row:
bins=5 2.1×) — irrelevant at bag=64 (nodes tiny, k→1 → all-values
anyway). ⇒ all-values. (`bins` knob since REMOVED — sweep is
all-values by construction; see next finding.)

## Faster cut + Y-injection + RF (2026-06-01) — `benchcut.py`/`rf.py`

Refactored `fft1.tree` to kill the per-value rescan (was
O(values·N)≈O(N²) per Num node). Added `yfun` (cut target
injectable, default klass — engine stays task-free); `cuts` yields,
`grow` does the `min` (selection in ONE place). `i`=self (loop=`j`).
- **Two implementations tried, both ~equal:** (a) single sorted
  sweep (prefix `Num` + suffix-`m2` snapshot) — `benchcut` 2.21→1.08
  ms/tree, h.626→.606, quality neutral; (b) **HISTOGRAM (the one
  that landed)** — `binOf` bins to `bins=7` edges, `merge`/unmerge
  (`merge(...,-1)`) for total∓side, cut value = `tree(...,bins=)`
  arg. End-to-end `pick.py` (-m300 -r5 -n2000): old rescan 4.53s →
  histogram 2.69s ≈ sweep 2.79s = **~1.7× faster**, histogram and
  sweep tied. (A scalar n,Σy,Σy² hand-roll hit 0.58 ms but dups
  `Num`; rejected — use `Num`/`merge` services for clarity.)
- **`the.B` trap (fixed):** histogram read bin count from `the.B`,
  but tasks build `the` from their OWN docstring (no `B=`) and set
  `fft1.the` → `the.B` None → crash. ⇒ count is a `tree(bins=7)`
  PARAM, not a global. Lesson: engine config must travel as args,
  not via the task-owned `the`.
- **Speedup shows in `pick.py` (~1.7×) but NOT the thesis figure**
  (~5.5min, flat): the figure is clone+eval+12×subprocess-CSV-load
  bound, so a cheaper cut barely moves wall-clock (re-confirms
  ablate "cost = build/clone, not eval").
- **Verified figure-level**: new engine == `l2.png` (semantically
  same clouds + picks; only RNG jitter). Checked in at `img/l2.png`.
- **RF variant REJECTED** (`rf.py`). Q: does random col-subspace +
  bigger random bags rescue all-cols best-cut (vs L3 collapse)? A:
  **no — loses on every axis.** vs L2 (ratio-64, 1 col, spread .268,
  .90ms, h.602): rf-sq (rand-256, sqrt cols) spread .119, 9.2ms,
  h.765; rf-all (all cols) spread .108, 25ms, h.726. Subspace did
  NOT restore diversity. **New result: the RATIO-SWEEP bag (10–90%
  pos) drives cloud spread, NOT the split mechanism** — `sq-64`
  (ratio bag + sqrt cols) keeps spread .232 vs rand-256's .11.
  feat>1 best-cut also hurts heaven (overfits small bags). ⇒ stay
  one-col + ratio-sweep bag. Confirms ablation: bagging+selection do
  the work; diversification operators inert/harmful.

## dims:trees / BINGO (2026-06-02) — `tree.py`/`pickdim.py`/`thesisdim.py`

From the "data-light / BINGO" paper (Ganguly & Menzies): SE data
clumps into n≪b^d buckets. Built a dims:trees pipeline as an
alternative to row-trees.
- `tree.py` (standalone, num-only CART-ish all-cols cut) + Fastmap
  `dims(data)`: orthogonal poles (sampled `few=32`) → each row a
  Dims-tuple of Bins bin-ids → BINGO buckets. compression r=n/N:
  adult .006, compas .015, diab .068 (strong clumping). Cut at REAL
  data values (max-in-bin), not synthetic edges.
- `pickdim.py` v2: collapse train to ~80 CELLS (one pre-summed label
  `Num` each); M cell-trees/projection over them (ratio-sweep =
  REWEIGHT cells, no resample → trees ~free); N projections/rep.
- **N:M settled by sweep (compas, 800 models):** cloud spread FLAT
  across N∈{1,4,10,40} (sd recall≈.41 everywhere) — extra
  projections add ZERO diversity. Ratio-sweep (M) is the sole
  diversity lever (3rd confirmation, after split-mechanism and
  RF-subspace both inert). Time rises with N. ⇒ **N=1**.
- **M-sweep (N=1):** M 800/400/200/100 → 54/29/14/8s (linear:
  scoring is the floor, cost ∝ M), test-heaven .550/.553/.555/.560
  (flat). ⇒ **M=100–200** plenty. At 8–14s/cell, dims:trees is
  FASTER than row `pick.py` (28s/cell): cells make trees free, N=1
  kills projection redundancy, low M kills scoring.
- **Quality (`img/l2dim.png` vs `img/l2.png`):** reproduces the
  headline — picks land top-right (recall+fairness preserved), diab
  floored, dutch deep-red. BUT precision ~0.09 LOWER (scale .30–.48
  vs .40–.57): projecting to 5 dims discards info raw-column cuts
  use for precision. Recall/fairness free; precision pays the toll.
- Bottleneck migrated cut→projection→**scoring** (score M models on
  val); see [[reprofile-bottleneck-moves]].
