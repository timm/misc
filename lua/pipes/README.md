# extreme n sampling

"The extreme always seems to make an impression." -- Christian
Slater

"I think the highest and lowest points are _the_ important ones.
Anything else is just...in between" -- Jim Morrison

If the primary concern is understanding the central behavior of a
distribution, methods like simple random sampling or stratified
random sampling might be more appropriate. Extreme sampling methods
are specifically designed for tail behavior.

An interesting feature of the geometry of MOO is *that* it is the
extreme bounds that interest us the most. The vert ivies of a polygon
surrodng a clound of options are where the response surface changes.
At the outer most vertices contaon the pareto frotnier, i.e. al
ppnts whose position cannot be altered without comparomising at
least ne goal.

assuming x ==> y then extreme x's lead to exterme y. an extreme
sampling assumes that x ==> y and that exterme values of x let  us
find exteme sampes of y.

note: support the reader douts this "extremem-is-best" assumption.
That line of thinking could result ina whole stream of interesting
resarech papers that expore an alternate
sampling policy. Here,
do a binary split on a line draw between two exteme points. An alterante
policy would be split that line $n>2$ times, then recurse
on multiple zones between the extermeities.
