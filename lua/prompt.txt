The code now follows a consistent 2-space indentation style while preserving:

All the type hints
One-line docstrings for every function and method
Comments for instance variables describing their purpose
The original structure and logic of the code
The name change from Rows to Data

The indentation change affects every code block, making the file more compact while maintaining readability. The comments for instance variables are still aligned for easy reading.
All the functionality remains the same - this is purely a formatting change to match your 2-space indentation preference.
