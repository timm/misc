The code now follows a consistent 2-space indentation style while preserving:

All the type hints
One-line docstrings for every function and method
Comments for instance variables describing their purpose
The original structure and logic of the code
The name change from Rows to Data

The indentation change affects every code block, making the file more compact while maintaining readability. The comments for instance variables are still aligned for easy reading.
All the functionality remains the same - this is purely a formatting change to match your 2-space indentation preference.

i i want a list of methods and attributes in each class

if methods/attributes  are related conceptually (in what smalltalk calls" protocols") thnen group the by those.  in each method list of each class, name each protocol and its purposea
here's an output string i want you to generate from kube.py

if methods are related conceptually (in what smalltalk calls" protocols") thnen group the by those.  in each method list of each class, name each protocol and its purpose



Analyze the given Python module and generate a structured summary of each class. For each class:

List all attributes (including private ones like _rows) along with their default values and a brief, paraphrased description (not verbatim comments).

Group methods into sensible conceptual clusters ("protocols") based on their names and docstrings. Use introspective grouping to infer protocol names that reflect the intent of each method group (e.g., data access, transformation, statistics, similarity).

Try to reuse protocol names across multiple classes where applicable to highlight structural similarity (e.g., if two classes have add and mid, place them under a shared protocol like core or stats).

Prefer short, descriptive protocol names (e.g., stats, distance, projection, setup, manage), but don't force-fit. Use an other group only if absolutely necessary.

Format the output clearly using Markdown-style layout, with a table of attributes and bullet-lists for each protocol.

Important: Include attributes created anywhere in the class (not just in __init__) ‚Äî especially private fields like _rows.

Here is your **final, full prompt**, incorporating everything discussed ‚Äî with focus on pedagogy, insight, low LOC, and internal consistency:

---

## üß† Prompt: Generate an Educational Website from a Python Script

> Given a Python script (e.g., `kube.py`), along with optional `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, generate a `.zip` file containing a compact, beginner-friendly HTML website that teaches and documents the code.
>
> Prioritize **brevity**, **clarity**, and **pedagogical value**. Avoid verbosity. Use minimal markup and **maximum insight per line**.

---

### üìë `index.html`

* Built from:

  * The **module-level docstring** at the top of the Python script
  * The full contents of `README.md`
* **Convert the first paragraph of `README.md` to HTML**, and **prepend it to the top of every HTML file** on the site.
* Convert the rest of the Markdown to HTML.
* The final section of `README.md` will be `## Refs`, containing entries like `### Menzies,2007`.

  * Convert each reference into an anchor (`<h3 id="menzies2007">Menzies,2007</h3>`)
  * Convert all in-text mentions like `Menzies,2007` to links: `index.html#menzies2007`

---

### üé® `style.css`

* Minimal CSS for:

  * Clean typography
  * Readable tables
  * Syntax-highlighted code blocks
  * Mobile-responsive layout
* Keep it lightweight, elegant, and consistent across all pages

---

### üß± `classes.html`

* Reflect over all classes in the script.
* For each class:

  * Include a **compact table of attributes**:

    * Include both public and private (e.g., `_rows`) attributes
    * Show default values (if present)
    * Add **short, paraphrased descriptions** of each attribute's purpose
  * Group methods into **conceptual protocols**:

    * Do **not** use hardcoded protocol categories
    * **Infer sensible, reusable names** from method names and docstrings
    * Favor minimal, shared protocol names (e.g., `core`, `stats`, `distance`, `projection`, `manage`, `density`)
    * List each method under its protocol with a **one-line summary**

---

### üìö `theory.html`

* Reflect over all functions beginning with `eg__`
* For each function:

  * Detect **any concept a beginner might not know** (e.g., entropy, memoization, cosine distance)
  * For each concept:

    * Create a **mini tutorial**, including:

      * A heading (linkable)
      * A concise definition
      * A motivating example
      * A compact code snippet (with syntax highlighting)
      * A one-sentence ‚Äúwhy it matters‚Äù
* Include a **TOC at the top** of all concept headings
* At the end of the page, list **5‚Äì10 review questions** appropriate for an exam or quiz:

  * Use a mix of multiple choice, short answer, or conceptual fill-in-the-blank
  * Target concepts covered in the tutorials

---

### üß™ `tut.html`

* For each `eg__*` function:

  * Present a **walkthrough**:

    * Break the function into chunks with **commented code blocks**
    * Explain each part with **compact inline commentary**
    * Link to related concepts in `theory.html`
  * Propose two tasks:

    * A **simple 1‚Äì10 minute task** (e.g., small variation or experiment)
    * A **harder assignment-level task** (e.g., suitable for a week-long project or homework)
    * Frame both tasks clearly and concisely

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è `license.html`

* Use the contents of `LICENSE`
* Prepend the first paragraph of `README.md` (converted to HTML) as an introductory note

---

### üì¶ Output Requirements

* Bundle all HTML and CSS files into a single `.zip` archive
* Use only **relative links**
* Ensure all content is fully **offline-capable**
* No external fonts, CDNs, or JavaScript dependencies

---

### üß† Global Constraints

* **Minimize total lines of code (LOC)** across all outputs
* Prefer compact tables, bullet points, and short paragraphs
* Avoid repetition and boilerplate
* Use insightful phrasing over exhaustive explanation
* **Teach like a human professor, not a static analyzer**
